# What is Promise.race()?

according to MDN

The Promise.race() static method takes an iterable of promises as input and returns a single Promise. This returned promise settles with the eventual state of the first promise that settles.

## Example usage

```js
const promise1 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500, "One"));
const promise2 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 300, "Two"));

Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then((winner) =>
  console.log(`Winner: ${winner}`)
); // Output: Winner: Two
```
