# What is Promise.resolve()?

according to MDN

The Promise.resolve() static method "resolves" a given value to a Promise. If the value is a promise, that promise is returned; if the value is a thenable, Promise.resolve() will call the then() method with two callbacks it prepared; otherwise the returned promise will be fulfilled with the value.

This function flattens nested layers of promise-like objects (e.g. a promise that fulfills to a promise that fulfills to something) into a single layer â€” a promise that fulfills to a non-thenable value.

## Example usage

```js
const resolvedPromise = Promise.resolve("Hello, Promises!");
resolvedPromise.then((result) => console.log(result)); // Output: Hello, Promises!
```

## Write a Promise.resolve() Polyfill

Testing Criteria

1. Non-Promise Value:

- Call your promise_resolve function with a non-promise value (e.g., a string or a number).
- Ensure the returned promise fulfills with the provided value.

2. Existing Promise:

- Create a promise using new Promise() and pass it to your promise_resolve function.
- Confirm that the returned promise is the same as the existing one.
